This repository was forked from ORB-SLAM3 https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM3. SuperPoint-SLAM is a modified version of ORB-SLAM3 which use SuperPoint as its feature detector and descriptor. The pre-trained model of SuperPoint come from https://github.com/MagicLeapResearch/SuperPointPretrainedNetwork.
This version is supposed to work with ORB-SLAM3 instead of ORB-SLAM2. This version is not optimised and might not outperfom ORB-SLAM3.

### V0.3: Beta version, 4 Sep 2020
**Authors:** Carlos Campos, Richard Elvira, Juan J. Gómez Rodríguez, [José M. M. Montiel](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~josemari/), [Juan D. Tardos](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~jdtardos/).

The [Changelog](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3/Changelog.md) describes the features of each version.

ORB-SLAM3 is the first real-time SLAM library able to perform **Visual, Visual-Inertial and Multi-Map SLAM** with **monocular, stereo and RGB-D** cameras, using **pin-hole and fisheye** lens models. In all sensor configurations, ORB-SLAM3 is as robust as the best systems available in the literature, and significantly more accurate. 

We provide examples to run ORB-SLAM3 in the [EuRoC dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) using stereo or monocular, with or without IMU, and in the [TUM-VI dataset](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/visual-inertial-dataset) using fisheye stereo or monocular, with or without IMU. Videos of some example executions can be found at [ORB-SLAM3 channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXVt-kXG6T95Z4tVaYlU80Q).

This software is based on [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) developed by [Raul Mur-Artal](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~raulmur/), [Juan D. Tardos](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~jdtardos/), [J. M. M. Montiel](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~josemari/) and [Dorian Galvez-Lopez](http://doriangalvez.com/) ([DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2)).

# 2. Prerequisites
We have tested the library in **Ubuntu 16.04** and **18.04**, but it should be easy to compile in other platforms. A powerful computer (e.g. i7) will ensure real-time performance and provide more stable and accurate results.

## C++11 or C++0x Compiler
We use the new thread and chrono functionalities of C++11.

## Pangolin
We use [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) for visualization and user interface. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.

## OpenCV
We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Required at leat 3.0. Tested with OpenCV 3.2.0**.

## Eigen3
Required by g2o (see below). Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0**.

## DBoW3 and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)
We use modified versions of the (https://github.com/rmsalinas/DBow3) library to perform place recognition and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library to perform non-linear optimizations. Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the *Thirdparty* folder.

## Python
Required to calculate the alignment of the trajectory with the ground truth. **Required Numpy module**.

* (win) http://www.python.org/downloads/windows
* (deb) `sudo apt install libpython2.7-dev`
* (mac) preinstalled with osx


## Libtorch

We use Pytorch C++ API to implement SuperPoint model. It can be built as follows:

git clone --recursive -b v1.0.1 https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch
cd pytorch && mkdir build && cd build
python ../tools/build_libtorch.py

It may take quite a long time to download and build. Please wait with patience.

NOTE: Do not use the pre-built package in the official website, it would cause some errors.


# 3. Building ORB-SLAM3 library and examples

We provide a script `build.sh` to build the *Thirdparty* libraries and *ORB-SLAM3*. Please make sure you have installed all required dependencies (see section 2). Execute:
```
cd Ms-Deep_SLAM
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This will create **libORB_SLAM3.so**  at *lib* folder and the executables in *Examples* folder.

# 4. Download Vocabulary

You can download the vocabulary from google drive https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p1QEXTDYsbpid5ELp3IApQ8PGgm_vguC/view. And then put it into Vocabulary directory. The vocabulary was trained on Bovisa_2008-09-01 using DBoW3 library. Branching factor k and depth levels L are set to 5 and 10 respectively.

#5. Monocular Examples
KITTI Dataset

Download the dataset (grayscale images) from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php

Execute the following command. Change KITTIX.yamlby KITTI00-02.yaml, KITTI03.yaml or KITTI04-12.yaml for sequence 0 to 2, 3, and 4 to 12 respectively. Change PATH_TO_DATASET_FOLDER to the uncompressed dataset folder. Change SEQUENCE_NUMBER to 00, 01, 02,.., 11.
